						FFmpeg can basically stream through one of two ways: It either streams to a some "other server", which re-streams
						for it to multiple clients, or it can stream via UDP/TCP directly to some single destination receiver, or
						alternatively directly to a multicast destination. Theoretically you might be able to send to multiple receivers
						via <a class="missing wiki">Creating Multiple Outputs?</a> but there is no built-in full blown server.
					</p>
					<p>
						Servers which can receive from FFmpeg (to restream to multiple clients) include <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/Streaming%20media%20with%20ffserver">ffserver</a>
						(linux only, though with cygwin it might work on windows), or <a class="ext-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wowza_Media_Server"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>Wowza Media Server</a>, or <a class="ext-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Media_Server"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>Flash Media Server</a>, Red5, or <a class="ext-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streaming_media_systems#Servers"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>various others</a>. Even <a class="ext-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>VLC</a> can pick up the stream from ffmpeg, then redistribute it, acting as a server.
						Since FFmpeg is at times more efficient than VLC at doing the raw encoding, this can be a useful option compared
						to doing both transcoding and streaming in VLC. <a class="ext-link" href="https://www.vultr.com/docs/setup-nginx-on-ubuntu-to-stream-live-hls-video"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>Nginx</a> also has an rtmp redistribution plugin, as does <a class="ext-link" href="http://h264.code-shop.com/trac/wiki"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>apache etc.</a> and there is probably more out there for apache, etc.. You can also live
						stream to online redistribution servers like own3d.tv or justin.tv (for instance streaming your desktop). Also
						any <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.flashrealtime.com/list-of-available-rtmp-servers/"><span class="icon">​</span>rtmp
							server</a> will most likely work to receive streams from FFmpeg (these typically require you to setup a running
						instance on a server).
					</p>
					<h2 id="The-reflag">The -re flag<a class="anchor" href="#The-reflag" title="Link to this section"> ¶</a></h2>
					<p>
						The FFmpeg's "-re" flag means to "Read input at native frame rate. Mainly used to simulate a grab device." i.e.
						if you wanted to stream a video file, then you would want to use this, otherwise it might stream it too fast (it
						attempts to stream at line speed by default). My guess is you typically don't want to use this flag when
						streaming from a live device, ever.

						Here is what another person once did for broadcast:
					</p>
					<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -f dshow -i video="Virtual-Camera" -preset ultrafast -vcodec libx264 -tune zerolatency -b 900k -f mpegts udp://10.1.0.102:1234
</pre>
					<p>
						And here is what another person <a class="ext-link" href="http://web.archiveorange.com/archive/v/DUtyPSinPqSIxjhedGQd"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>did</a>:
					</p>
					<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -f dshow -i video="screen-capture-recorder":audio="Stereo Mix (IDT High Definition" \
-vcodec libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -r 10 -async 1 -acodec libmp3lame -ab 24k -ar 22050 -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb \
-maxrate 750k -bufsize 3000k -f mpegts udp://192.168.5.215:48550
</pre>
					<p>
						NB that they also (for directshow devices) had to adjust the rtbufsize in that example.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can see a description of what some of these means, (for example bufsize, bitrate settings) in the <a class="wiki"
						 href="/wiki/Encode/H.264">Encode/H.264</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's how one guy broadcast a live stream (in this instance a <a class="missing wiki">Capture/Desktop#Windows?</a>
						screen capture device):
					</p>
					<pre class="wiki">$ ffmpeg -y -loglevel warning -f dshow -i video="screen-capture-recorder" -vf crop=690:388:136:0 -r 30 -s 962x388 -threads 2 -vcodec libx264 -vpre baseline -vpre my_ffpreset -f flv rtmp:///live/myStream.sdp
</pre>
					<p>
						with a custom FFmpeg preset (libx264-my_ffpreset.ffpreset) in this case:
					</p>
					<pre class="wiki">coder=1

					<p>
						Here is how you stream to twitch.tv or similar services (rtmp protocol), using ffmpeg 1.0 or ffmpeg-git (tested
						on 2012-11-12), this is also for pulseaudio users:
						Example 1, no sound:
					</p>
					<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1200 -framerate 15 -i :0.0 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1280x800 -threads 0 -f flv "rtmp://live.twitch.tv/app/live_********_******************************"
</pre>
					<p>
						Example 2, first screen (on dual screen setup, or if on a single screen):
					</p>
					<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1200 -framerate 15 -i :0.0 -f pulse -ac 2 -i default -c:v libx264 -preset fast -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1280x800 -c:a aac -b:a 160k -ar 44100 -threads 0 -f flv "rtmp://live.twitch.tv/app/live_********_******************************"
</pre>
					<p>
						Example 3, second screen (on dual screen setup):
					</p>
					<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -f x11grab -s 1920x1200 -framerate 15 -i :0.0+1920,0 -f pulse -ac 2 -i default -c:v libx264 -preset fast -pix_fmt yuv420p -s 1280x800 -c:a aac -b:a 160k -ar 44100 -threads 0 -f flv "rtmp://live.twitch.tv/app/live_********_******************************"
</pre>
					<h2 id="Latency">Latency<a class="anchor" href="#Latency" title="Link to this section"> ¶</a></h2>
					<p>
						You may be able to decrease initial "startup" latency by specifing that I-frames come "more frequently" (or
						basically always, in the case of <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/Encode/H.264">x264</a>'s zerolatency setting),
						though this can increase frame size and decrease quality, see <a class="ext-link" href="http://mewiki.project357.com/wiki/X264_Encoding_Suggestions"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>here</a> for some more background. Basically for typical x264 streams, it inserts an
						I-frame every 250 frames. This means that new clients that connect to the stream may have to wait up to 250
						frames before they can start receiving the stream (or start with old data). So increasing I-frame frequency
						(makes the stream larger, but might decrease latency). For real time captures you can also decrease latency of
						audio in windows dshow by using the dshow audio_buffer_size <a class="ext-link" href="http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Options"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>setting</a>. You can also decrease latency by tuning any broadcast server you are using to
						minimize latency, and finally by tuning the client that receives the stream to not "cache" any incoming data,
						which, if it does, increases latency.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sometimes audio codecs also introduce some latency of their own. You may be able to get less latency by using
						speex, for example, or opus, in place of libmp3lame.
					</p>
					<p>
						You will also want to try and decrease latency at the server side, for instance <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.wowza.com/forums/content.php?81-How-to-achieve-the-lowest-latency-from-capture-to-playback"><span
							 class="icon">​</span>wowza</a> hints.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also setting -probesize and -analyzeduration to low values may help your stream start up more quickly (it uses
						these to scan for "streams" in certain muxers, like ts, where some can appears "later", and also to estimate the
						duration, which, for live streams, the latter you don't need anyway). This should be unneeded by dshow input.
					</p>
					<p>
						Reducing cacheing at the client side can help, too, for instance mplayer has a "-nocache" option, other players
						may similarly has some type of pre-playback buffering that is occurring. (The reality is mplayers -benchmark
						option has much more effect).
					</p>
					<p>
						Using an encoder that encodes more quickly (or possibly even raw format?) might reduce latency.
					</p>
					<p>
						You might get less latency by using one of the "point to point" protocols described in this document, at well.
						You'd lose the benefit of having a server, of course.
					</p>
					<p>
						NB that a client when it initially starts up may have to wait until the next i-frame to be able to start
						receiving the stream (ex: if receiving UDP), so the GOP setting (-g) i-frame interval will have an effect on how
						quickly they can start streaming (i.e. they must receive an i-frame before they start). Setting it to a lower
						number means it will use more bandwidth, but clients will be able to connect more quickly (the default for x264
						is 250--so for 30 fps that means an i-frame only once every 10 seconds or so). So it's a tradeoff if you adjust
						it. This does not affect actual latency (just connection time) since the client can still display frames very
						quickly after and once it has received its first i-frame. Also if you're using a lossy transport, like UDP, then
						an i-frame represents "the next change it will have to repair the stream" if there are problems from packet loss.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can also (if capturing from a live source) increase frame rate to decrease latency (which affects throughput
						and also i-frame frequency, of course). This obvious sends packets more frequently, so (with 5 fps, you introduce
						at least a 0.2s latency, with 10 fps 0.1s latency) but it also helps clients to fill their internal buffers, etc.
						more quickly.
					</p>
					<p>
						Note also that using dshow's "rtbufsize" has the unfortunate side effect of sometimes allowing frames to "buffer"
						while it is waiting on encoding of previous frames, or waiting for them to be sent over the wire. This means that
						if you use a higher value at all, it can cause/introduce added latency if it ever gets used (but if used, can be
						helpful for other aspects, like transmitting more frames overall consistently etc. so YMMV). Almost certainly if
						you set a very large value for this, and then see the "buffer XX% full! dropping!" message, you are introducing
						latency.
					</p>
					<p>
						There is also apparently an option -fflags nobuffer which might possibly help, usually for receiving streams <a
						 class="ext-link" href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-formats.html#Format-Options"><span class="icon">​</span>reduce

						<h3 id="Testinglatency">Testing latency<a class="anchor" href="#Testinglatency" title="Link to this section"> ¶</a></h3>
						<p>
							By default, ffplay (as a receiver for testing latency) introduces significant latency of its own, so if you use
							it for testing (see troubleshooting section) it may not reflect latency accurately. FFplay introduces some video
							artifacts, also, see notes for it in "troubleshooting streaming" section Also some settings mentioned above like
							"probesize" might help it start more quickly. Also useful:
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffplay -probesize 32 -sync ext INPUT
</pre>
						<p>
							(the sync part tells it to try and stay realtime).
						</p>
						<p>
							Useful is mplayer with its -benchmark for testing latency (-noaudio and/or -nocache *might* be useful, though I
							haven't found -nocache to provide any latency benefit it might work for you).
						</p>
						<p>
							Using the SDL out option while using FFmpeg to receive the stream might also help to view frames with less
							client side latency: "ffmpeg ... -f sdl &lt;input_here&gt; "window title"" (this works especially well with
							-fflags nobuffer, though in my tests is still barely more latency than using mplayer -benchmark always). This
							doesn't have a "drop frames if you run out of cpu" option so it can get quite far behind at times (introduce
							more latency variably).
						</p>
						<p>
							Another possibly useful receiving client is "omxplayer -live"
						</p>
						<p>
							See also "Point to point streaming" section esp. if you use UDP etc.

						<h2 id="CPUusageFilesize">CPU usage / File size<a class="anchor" href="#CPUusageFilesize" title="Link to this section">

						<p>
							In general, the more CPU you use to compress, the better the output image will be, or the smaller of a file the
							output will be for the same quality.
						</p>
						<p>
							Basically, the easiest way to save cpu is to decrease the input frame rate/size, or decrease the output frame
							rate/size.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also you could (if capturing from live source), instruct the live source to feed a "smaller stream" (ex: webcam
							stream 640x480 instead of 1024x1280), or you could set a lower output "output quality" setting (q level), or
							specify a lower output desired bitrate (see <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/Encode/H.264">Encode/H.264</a> for a
							background). Or try a different output codec, or specify new parameters to your codec (for instance, a different
							profile or preset for <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/Encode/H.264">libx264</a>). Specifying $ -threads 0 instructs
							the encoder to use all available cpu cores, which is the default. You could also resize the input first, before
							transcoding it, so it's not as large. Applying a smoothing filter like hqdn3d before encoding might help it
							compress better, yielding smaller files.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also set a lower output frame rate to of course decrease cpu usage.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you're able to live capture in a pixel format that matches your output format (ex: yuv420p output from a
							webcam, instead of mjpeg), that might help with cpu usage, since it avoids an extra conversion. Using 64-bit
							instead of 32-bit executables (for those that have that choice) can result in a slight speedup. If you're able
							to use -vcodec copy that, of course, uses the least cpu of all options since it just sends the frames verbatim
							to the output.
						</p>
						<p>
							Sometimes you can change the "pixel formats" somehow, like using rgb16 instead of rgb24, to save time/space (or
							yuv420 instead of yuv444 or the like, since 420 stores less information it may compress better and use less
							bandwidth). This may not affect latency.

						<p>
							FFmpeg can stream a single stream using the <a class="ext-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Transport_Protocol"><span
								 class="icon">​</span>RTP protocol</a>. In order to avoid buffering problems on the other hand, the streaming
							should be done through the -re option, which means that the stream will be streamed in real-time (i.e. it slows
							it down to simulate a live streaming <a class="ext-link" href="http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html"><span class="icon">​</span>source</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example the following command will generate a signal, and will stream it to the port 1234 on localhost:
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -re -f lavfi -i aevalsrc="sin(400*2*PI*t)" -ar 8000 -f mulaw -f rtp rtp://127.0.0.1:1234
</pre>
						<p>
							To play the stream with ffplay (which has some caveats, see above), run the command:
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffplay rtp://127.0.0.1:1234
</pre>
						<p>
							Note that rtp by default uses UDP, which, for large streams, can cause packet loss. See the "point to point"
							section in this document for hints if this ever happens to you.
						</p>
						<h2 id="Codecs">Codecs<a class="anchor" href="#Codecs" title="Link to this section"> ¶</a></h2>
						<p>
							The most popular streaming codec is probably <a class="ext-link" href="http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html"><span
								 class="icon">​</span>libx264</a>, though if you're streaming to a device which requires a "crippled" baseline
							h264 implementation, you can use the x264 "baseline" profile. Some have have argued that the mp4 video codec is
							<a class="ext-link" href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=398016"><span class="icon">​</span>better</a>
							than x264 baseline, because it encodes about as well with less cpu. You may be able to use other codecs, like
							mpeg2video, or really any other video codec you want, typically, as long as your receiver can decode it, if it
							suits your needs.
						</p>
						<p>
							Also note that encoding it to the x264 "baseline" is basically a "compatibility mode" for older iOS devices or
							the like, see <a class="ext-link" href="http://sonnati.wordpress.com/2011/08/30/ffmpeg-%E2%80%93-the-swiss-army-knife-of-internet-streaming-%E2%80%93-part-iv/"><span
								 class="icon">​</span>here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The mpeg4 video codec sometimes also comes "within a few percentage" of the compression of x264 "normal
							settings", but uses much less cpu to do the encoding. See <a class="ext-link" href="http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=631&amp;hilit=mpeg4+libx264+cores&amp;start=10#p2163"><span

							for some graphs (which may be slightly outdated). Basically in that particular test it was 54 fps to 58 fps
							(libx264 faster), and libx264 file was 5.1MB and mpeg4 was 6MB, but mpeg4 used only half as much cpu for its
							computation, so take it with a grain of salt.

							only be able to accept from a webcam or some other source from at most one process, in this case you'll need to
							"split" your output if you want to save it and stream it simultaneously. Streaming and saving simultaneously
							(and only encoding once) can also save cpu.

							One mailing list user wrote this, quote:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								In my application, I have a server running vlc sucking streams from some cameras, encoding them as MPEG2
								streams and sending them to ports 5000 through 5003 on my intermediary server (I'll have to let someone else
								explain how to set that up, as that was someone else's part of the project). I have another server running
								Wowza, with an instance named "live". And I've got an intermediate server that sucks in MPEG2 streams coming in
								on ports 5000 to 5003, transcoding them into mp4 streams with H.264 and AAC codecs, and pushing the transcoded
								streams on to Wowza.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								The command line I use to pull the stream from port 5000, transcode it, and push it is:
								ffmpeg -i 'udp://localhost:5000?fifo_size=1000000&amp;overrun_nonfatal=1' -crf 30 -preset ultrafast -acodec aac
								-strict experimental -ar 44100 -ac 2 -b:a 96k -vcodec libx264 -r 25 -b:v 500k -f flv 'rtmp://&lt;wowza server
								IP&gt;/live/cam0'
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								-i 'udp://localhost:5000?fifo_size=1000000&amp;overrun_nonfatal=1' tells ffmpeg where to pull the input stream
								from. The parts after the ? are probably not needed most of the time, but I did need it after all.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								-crf 30 sets the Content Rate Factor. That's an x264 argument that tries to keep reasonably consistent video
								quality, while varying bitrate during more 'complicated' scenes, etc. A value of 30 allows somewhat lower
								quality and bit rate. See <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/Encode/H.264">Encode/H.264</a>.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								-preset ultrafast as the name implies provides for the fastest possible encoding. If some tradeoff between
								quality and encode speed, go for the speed. This might be needed if you are going to be transcoding multiple
								streams on one machine.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								-acodec aac sets the audio codec (internal AAC encoder)
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								-strict experimental allows use of some experimental codecs (the internal AAC encoder is experimental)
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								-ar 44100 set the audio sample rate
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								-ac 2 specifies two channels of audio

							FFmpeg doesn't (today) support varying the encoding bitrate based on fluctuating network conditions. It does
							support outputting in several "different" fixed bitrates, at the same time, however, see "Streaming with
							multiple bitrates" on this page, which is vaguely related. Also if you are during direct capture from
							directshow, the input device starts dropping frames when there is congestion, which somewhat simulates a
							variable outgoing bitrate.

							If you get a "black/blank" screen in the client, try sending it yuv422p or yuv420p type input. Some servers get
							confused if you send them yuv444 input (which is the default for libx264).
						</p>
						<p>
							NB that when you are testing your stream settings, you may want to test them with both VLC and <a class="ext-link"
							 href="http://ffmpeg.org/ffplay.html"><span class="icon">​</span>FFplay</a>, as FFplay sometimes introduces its
							own artifacts when it is scaled (FFplay uses poor quality default scaling, which can be inaccurate). Don't use
							ffplay as your baseline for determining quality.

								¶</a></h2>
						<p>
							If you want to stream "from one computer to another", you could start up a server on one, and then stream from
							FFmpeg to that server, then have the client connect to that server (server could either be on client or server
							side computers). Or you could do a point to point type stream, like:
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -i INPUT -acodec libmp3lame -ar 11025 --f rtp rtp://host:port
</pre>
						<p>
							where host is the receiving IP. Then receive the stream using VLC or ffmpeg from that port (since rtp uses UDP,
							the receiver can start up any time).
						</p>
						<p>
							or
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -i INPUT -f mpegts udp://host:port
</pre>
						<p>
							If you run into packet loss (green frames, tearing/shearing--since UDP is not guaranteed delivery, this can
							occur) first make sure your FFmpeg is compiled with pthreads support enabled (if it is, then it uses a separate
							thread to receive from the UDP port, which can cause less packet loss). You can tell that it is by specifying a
							url like udp://host:post?fifo_size=10000 (if it accepts fifo_size, then you're good to go). Similarly, for
							mplayer, you can use mplayer ffmpeg://udp://host:port?fifo_size=XXX for possibly better results on the receiving
							end (mplayer needs a patch first, email <a class="mail-link" href="mailto:rogerdpack@gmail.com"><span class="icon">​</span>rogerdpack@gmail.com</a>
							for it, once was <a class="ext-link" href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rdp/9075572/raw/002dc1b745c895693fdb160cc9be77ef31f75531/possible_mplayer_udp_fix.diff"><span
								 class="icon">​</span>https://gist.githubusercontent.com/rdp/9075572/raw/002dc1b745c895693fdb160cc9be77ef31f75531/possible_mplayer_udp_fix.diff</a>
							hackey work around patch, applied with ffmpeg subdir).
						</p>
						<p>
							Alternatively, increase your buffer size, like mplayer ffmpeg://udp://host:port?buffer_size=10000000 (the
							default is system dependent and typically far too low for any reasonable buffering. On linux though you can only
							set it to like 200K max anyway, so this isn't good enough--make sure to use the circular buffer, and that the
							following works: ffmpeg://udp://host:port?buffer_size=10000000?fifo_size=100000 (the fifo_size should not emit a
							warning, and implies that you have a secondary thread that collects incoming packets for you if there is no
							warning).
						</p>
						<p>
							Another option is to use some transmission type that uses TCP for your transport. (The RTMP protocol, popular in
							streaming to servers, uses TCP probably for this reason--you just can't use that for point to point streaming).
						</p>
						<p>
							One option to use TCP is like this:
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -i INPUT -f mpegts tcp://host:port
</pre>
						<p>
							which I would guess will try and (as a client) establish a connection do that host on that port (assuming it has
							a server waiting for the incoming connection). You could receive it like this:
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -i tcp://local_hostname:port?listen
</pre>
						<p>
							(basically, one side needs to specify "listen" and the other needs to not to).
						</p>
						<p>
							To use with mplayer as a receiver it would be like
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -i ... -f mpegts "tcp://127.0.0.1:2000"
</pre>
						<p>
							and on the mplayer side
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">mplayer ... ffmpeg://tcp://127.0.0.1:2000?listen
</pre>
						<p>
							(start mplayer first)
						</p>
						<p>
							Another option is to use RTP (which by default uses UDP) but by specifying it use TCP:
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -i input -f rtsp -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://localhost:8888/live.sdp
</pre>
						<p>
							(For meanings of options see <a class="ext-link" href="http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-protocols.html#rtsp"><span class="icon">​</span>official
								documentation</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Then you may receive it like this (ffplay or ffmpeg):
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffplay -rtsp_flags listen rtsp://localhost:8888/live.sdp?tcp
# ending "?tcp" may not be needed -- you will need to start the server up first, before the sending client
</pre>
						<p>
							ffmpeg also has a "listen" option for rtmp so it may be able to receive a "straight" rtmp streams from a single
							client that way.
						</p>
						<p>
							With tcp based streams you can probably use any formatting/muxer, but with udp you need to be careful and use a
							muxer that supports 'connecting anytime' like mpegts.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are forced to use udp (for instance you need to broadcast to a multicast port for whatever reason) then
							you may be able to avoid the packet loss by (sending less data or sending the same frames over and over again so
							they have a higher chance of being received).
						</p>
						<p>
							See also the section on i-frames in <a class="wiki" href="/wiki/StreamingGuide#Latency">#Latency</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Final working p2p client, with multicast:
						</p>
						<p>
							server:
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">ffmpeg -f dshow  -framerate 20 -i video=screen-capture-recorder -vf scale=1280:720 -vcodec libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -tune zerolatency -preset ultrafast -f mpegts udp://236.0.0.1:2000
</pre>
						<p>
							client:
						</p>
						<pre class="wiki">mplayer -demuxer +mpegts -framedrop -benchmark ffmpeg://udp://236.0.0.1:2000?fifo_size=100000&amp;buffer_size=10000000
# (see note above about linux needing fifo_size as well as buffer_size).
